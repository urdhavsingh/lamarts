<p><span id="first">L</span>a Martiniere College, Lucknow, established in 1845, was founded in accordance with the Will of Major General 
Claude Martin. Born in Lyon, France, in 1735, the Founder died in Lucknow on 13 September, 1800. 
The day of his death, by his own instructions is commemorated as ‘Founder’s Day’. 
Under his Will, certain funds were allotted for the establishment of schools at Lyon, his birth place in France, 
in Calcutta and at Lucknow.</p>

<p>Today, La Martiniere College imparts instruction through the medium of English and admission to the College 
is eagerly sought. Over the span of one and a half centuries, the College has produced soldiers, sailors
 and airmen who have done the school and their country proud in the two World Wars and in the wars of 
 Independent India. It has also produced engineers, doctors, educationists, administrators and outstanding
 sportsmen, now scattered over the globe. It counts among its illustrious alumni, men of War and Peace 
 – the Keelor brothers awarded with the Vir Chakra, for shooting down Sabre jets in the
Indo-Pak War (1965) and the Nobel Peace Laureate, Dr Rajendra Pachauri.</p>


 <p>On 01 October, 1995, the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the College, the President of India, 
acknowledged the contribution of the College by releasing a postage stamp of the denomination of Rs 2.00, as a mark 
of honour. This, again, is a mark of distinction that only a few other institutions in India enjoy.</p>

<h2> CLAUDE MARTIN'S COAT OF ARMS</h2>
<p>Claude Martin designed his own coat of arms. The escutcheon or central shield bears charges or
emblems, which epitomise his career. The escutcheon is supported by seven standards bearing the
motif of the fish.</p>
<p>The device of the sailing ship represents the nautical influences in Claude Martin's career – his
voyage from France to India, the events related to his travel from Pondicherry to Calcutta over
the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>In the centre of the shield is the lion rampant with the pennant. This is similar to one of the lions
on the coat of arms of the East India Company.
The rock symbolizes the establishment and foundation of his fortunes. The East India Company
lion stands upon this rock. It was as an officer of the Company that Claude Martin made his
fortune.</p>
<p>The castellated building is a device that represents Constantia, his final architectural achievement
that had an overpowering role in his latter years.</p>
<p>The sun setting behind Constantia reflects the sunset of his days.</p>
<p>The supporters on each side of the escutcheon are made up of three standards on the left and four
standards on the right. Each bears the motif of the fish. The seven standards were part of the
armorial bearing of the Nawabs of Oudh and could only have been used with the permission of
Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula.</p>
<p>The dominant tinctures are gold and azure (blue). The College colours are Navy Blue and Old
Gold.</p>
<p>Claude Martin's personal motto, the Latin, Labore et Constantia on a scroll below the
escutcheon and supporters completes the picture. This is also the motto of all La Martiniere
schools, which exhorts its pupils to Labour and Constancy.</p>

<h1><a name="khaki"></a>The Romance of Khaki</h1>
<div class="houses">
      <div class="text">
       <p>One of the distinctive features of La Martiniere College, Lucknow is the College uniform,
 worn by its pupils in summer. Khaki is ubiquitous and associated exclusively with the boys of this College.
 Khaki uniform was introduced at La Martiniere College following the events of 1857
 . Its use is attributed to the pivotal, though controversial character, in the events of the sacking
 of Lucknow in 1857- Brevet Major W. S. R. Hodson who lies buried on La Martiniere estate.</p>
<p>Khaki, as a colour and material for uniform was first worn by the Corps of Guides that was raised in December 1846
 as the brain-child of Sir Henry Lawrence, who later served as the British Resident at Lucknow during the events of 1857.
 Lawrence chose Sir Harry Lumsden as the Commandant of the Corps and William Stephen Raikes Hodson as its
 adjutant and second-in-command to begin the process of raising the Corps of Guides.</p>
<p>Significantly, Hodson was given the task of designing the uniform and clothing the men. This was years before
 it became the uniform of the British Army. In May 1848 he liaised with his brother Rev. George Hodson,
 in England, to send the cloth, rifles and Prussian-style helmets required for his men. With Lumsden’s approval,
 Hodson decided upon a lightweight uniform of Khaki colour – or ‘drab’ as it was then referred to. This would be 
 comfortable to wear and ‘make them invisible in a land of dust’. As a result Hodson and Lumsden have the joint
 distinction of being the first officers to equip a regiment dressed in Khaki, which many view as the precursor
 of modern camouflage uniform.</p>
<p>For years, the tailoring of khaki uniform for the pupils of the College followed the pattern of the uniform
 used by Hodson’s troops. This included the Prussian-style helmets which were gradually replaced by cane helmets
 and solar-topis. Changes in style were introduced closer to the Second World War. The military character of the
 College was gradually being replaced as a College for gentlemen. Neckties were introduced and the cumbersome
 solar-topis were abandoned.</p>
<p>The colour of the uniform remains unchanged. There are changes in design to accommodate modern tailoring patterns.
 Absorbent, cellular cotton cloth has now been replaced by the easier to maintain terrycot. Khaki uniform continues
 proudly worn by all boys.</p>
<p>A recent tradition is for the school leaving class to autograph the uniform of batch-mates and to include
 personalised messages in nostalgic memory.</p>
